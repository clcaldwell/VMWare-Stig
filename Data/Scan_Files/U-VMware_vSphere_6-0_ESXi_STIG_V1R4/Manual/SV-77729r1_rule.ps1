From the vSphere Client select the ESXi Host and go to Configuration >> Security Profile.  Under Services select Edit and view the "SSH" service and verify it is stopped.

From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host run the following command:

Get-VMHost | Get-VMHostService | Where {$_.Label -eq "SSH"}
